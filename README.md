# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ON YOUTUBE DATASET
The purpose of the project is to get started with the Exploratory Data Analysis using Python

# GOALS OF THE PROJECT
1. To have a better understanding on Exploratory Data Analysis.
2. To build various plots and draw inference from them.
3. To get familiar with the python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.

# MATERIALS ATTACHED
1. Dataset used in the project
2. Description of the features used
3. Project code

# TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED 
1. JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
2. NUMPY
3. PANDAS
4. MATPLOTLIB
5. SEABORN

# STEPS INVOLVED
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle the missing values.
2. Correlation Analysis: Analyze the relationships between different variables.
3. Visualizations: Create bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and pie charts to highlight key findings.
4. Insights and Conclusions: Inferences are drawn from the plotted charts and graphs about the data.
